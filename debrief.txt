what did we do well
+ organization
= trello
= visual organization
= who will do what
= google docs
+ everyone knew their objective
+ everyone did something/what they were suppossed to do
+ communication
= forming two groups (backend/frontend)
+ chain of command (point + sub heads)

what didnt go so well - what could we do better
+ setting deadlines (x2)
+ meeting outside class
+ earlier debrief meetings
+ more documentation and naming setup
+ communication for new functions
+ more than 1 person in both backend and frontend
+ splitting up too early (b/f end)
+ git issues

what did you like about the project
+ having a specfic role
= less daunting when focusing on the specfics
+ having the project be used later

thoughts on team dynamic
+ communication could have been better between ends
= front end communicated well within itself
= backend didnt communicate well
+ wish there was more group projects in class or for homework
= no group projects until this semester
= pairs: projects are very small scale and it is easier to put mettings together
+ trello was good for pseudo-logging/communication

how do you feel about the final project
+ enjoyed, but another week would have been good
= prep for documentation
= post debrief for wrap up before final
+ timeline was good for when things are recommended for being due

if you could change one thing over the course of the project, what would you change
+ setting a standard location to go to for contact of others
+ setup a good layout for dealines or a plan of action
+ defining format
= naming conventions
= so things look more alike
+ done breaak into two groups so early
= staying together so that when front end splits off, they have some form of insight into the backend
